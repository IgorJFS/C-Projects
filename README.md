# This is a repository for low-level programming experiments and projects.

I was interested in exploring low-level programming concepts, so I created this repository to document my journey and share my findings with others.
Feel free to browse and test through the code, experiments, and notes I've compiled here.

The command Im using to compile the C programs in this repository is:
```bash
gcc fileExample.c -o fileExample.exe && fileExample.exe
```
